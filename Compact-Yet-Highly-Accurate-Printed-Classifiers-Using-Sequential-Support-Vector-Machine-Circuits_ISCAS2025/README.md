# Highly-Accurate Sequential Support Vector Machines Targeting Printed Electronics

This repository contains the hardware designs and Verilog implementations of **sequential Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers** optimized for **Printed Electronics (PE)**. These classifiers significantly reduce area and power consumption compared to state-of-the-art printed ML models while maintaining high classification accuracy.

## 📜 Abstract
Printed Electronics (PE) technology has emerged as a promising alternative to silicon-based computing, offering **low fabrication costs, mechanical flexibility, and conformality**. However, the large feature sizes of PE limit the realization of complex printed **Machine Learning (ML) classifiers**. 

Our work introduces **the first sequential SVM classifiers** tailored for PE, achieving **6× lower area** and **4.6% higher accuracy** than existing printed ML classifiers. By leveraging **bespoke control and storage units** along with a **single Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) compute engine**, we mitigate accuracy loss while maintaining area and power efficiency.
