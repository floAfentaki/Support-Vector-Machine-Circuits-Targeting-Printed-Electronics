##  Support-Vector-Machine-Circuits-Targeting-Printed-Electronics

Printed Electronics (PE) is a game-changer in technology, offering unique benefits that make it perfect for widespread computing. 
It's useful in areas needing flexible and low-cost solutions, where regular computers struggle.
 Unlike typical technologies using silicon, PE has ultra low costs and can create bendable, non-toxic, and stretchy hardware on the spot.

But, there's a catch. PE has large feature sizes, making it hard to create complex circuits like the ones needed for machine learning. 
This challenge is something we're working on, figuring out how to balance PE's awesome advantages with these tricky parts to make it even better for the future.
